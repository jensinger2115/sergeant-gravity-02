\section{Introduction}
This is our review of Group 03. 
 
\section{Problems in the requirements}
\subsection{}
UR002: There shall be no monetarization of the software, such as advertisements. (corresponding system requirement: NFR034)
This Statement does not affect the development of the application. Furthermore UR001 already states that the finished product will be published as an open-source product, implication that there will be no monetization.
\subsection{}
UR003: The language of the website shall be English. 
Although this is true, the client wants the whole application to be in english. So not only the website, but also the installation process etc. shall be in English. In the corresponding system requirement this mistake is fixed: 
NFR007: The system language is English.
\subsection{}
UR010: The website should offer a version for mobile devices. 
As far as we understood it, the website should be readable via mobile devices. There does not need to be an extra version for them. In general it seems improbable that users would want to do data mining with a mobile devices since they have very limit disk space for trainings and/or test data.
