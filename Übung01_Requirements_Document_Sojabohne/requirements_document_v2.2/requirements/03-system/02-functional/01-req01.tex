\end{description}

\paragraph{FR005}
\begin{description}
\item [Statement] \textit{
People can registered themselves to the application. Therefore they need three things: 
	\\-Username: Usernames can only contain letters (a-z), numbers (0-9), dashes (\-), underscores (\_), apostrophes (\'), and periods (\.) (and must be unique?).
	\\-Password: Passwords can contain any combination of ASCII characters and must contain a minimum of 8 characters

\\
\\3.) Create new model: 
\\o   Upload data (.arff, .csv format)  (See UR0107.0)
\\o   Choose split factor of data into training and test data (in \%)
\\o   Optionally upload test data (.arff, .csv format)

\\o   Optionally set description
\\o   Optionally change permissions
\\
\\4.) Upload new algorithms: (See UR0501.0)

\\o   Uploaded algorithms must be approved by an administrator before the may be used. (See UR0501.1)
\\o Registered users only
\\
\\5.) Upload existing model: (See UR0115.0)
\\o   Must be a serialized java object (See UR0107.0)

\paragraph{FR014}

    \textit{
Additionally administrators have an extra view with the following options:
\\1.) Administrators can set constraints to the anonymous users:
\\o   Time constraints: Administrators can set (See UR0602.2.1)
\\§  Time limits (in minutes) for algorithms (individually ?) (See UR0602.2.1.2)
\\§  An expiration date for data packages (in days), after which data packages are deleted from the database (See UR0602.2.1.1)
\\o   Space constraints: Administrators can set a maximum upload file size (in GB) (See UR0602.2.2)
\\
\\2.) Administrators can  set the maximum number of simultaneously running algorithms for the whole application AND every single user (See UR0603.2 /UR0603.3)
\\
\\3.) Administrators can ban user from the application. Banned users are deleted from the system. (This entails deleting all data packages created by the banned user) (See UR0603.1)
\\
\\4.) Administrators have an overview over all work request and can cancel any number of them and change the order of the request in the workflow-queue
\\
\\5.)Administrators have a view over all request for new algorithms. They may download them to check the code and then approve them.
\\o   Approved algorithms are considered active and can be run by all users
\\o   Administrators can also deactivate algorithms

If the number of simultaneously running algorithms reaches the limit given by the (See UR0507.0) administration any new request are entered into a workflow-queue.

Based on the users trainings data input the choice of algorithms is limited. (e.g.: if input data  contains floating point numbers, then only algorithms that can handle those numbers will be available)
